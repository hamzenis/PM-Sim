												SoftDsim is a Django-based web application designed for simulating
												project management scenarios to be used in the Project Management module
												at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. The web application
												SoftDSim was developed in 2022 by a student project group. It serves as
												a project management simulation for educational purposes. This
												simulation allows students to take on the role of a project manager and
												simulate a dynamic project management scenario. In doing so, students
												must make decisions to complete the scenario as successfully as
												possible, considering the magical project management triangle (quality,
												cost, time). The tool offers various actions to choose from, including
												adding or removing developers, setting overtime and Training, as well as
												assigning tasks such as solving tasks, testing, or bugfixing.
											</p>
											<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
												SoftDSim is an educational simulation designed to raise awareness among
												students about decision-making in project management. The scenarios in
												SoftDSim can only be created by professors. Students have the valuable
												opportunity to play these scenarios and gain an authentic insight into
												the work of a project manager. The main goal of the simulation is to
												achieve a sustainable learning effect by having noticeable effects
												following all actions, even if they go beyond a realistic extent. This
												creates a more immersive learning experience. The effects achieved
												include both the impacts of the simulation state that students can
												monitor on a dashboard, as well as the direct consequences of the
												actions taken by the students.
											</p>
											<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
												For example, increased team motivation can lead to a greater number of
												completed tasks, while increased stress can result in more errors. It is
												important that the effects of the students' actions are tangible,
												whether it be in the form of increased stress during overtime or
												enhanced project familiarity through conducting meetings.
											</p>
											<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
												Overall, SoftDSim enables students to have an interactive and realistic
												learning experience in the field of project management, strengthening
												their decision-making and problem-solving skills.

												By selecting a scenario from the overview, the "Story" of the scenario
												opens. The Story describes the scenario and the project's content. It

												of a simulation provides a comprehensive overview of the project and
												allows participants to have important information at their disposal. For
												example, it may outline the project prerequisites and the project
												management methodology to be applied. The Story helps students to better
												understand the context of the scenario and facilitates the
												identification of challenges and decisions to be made during the
												simulation. The "Start Simulation" button initiates the simulation.
												During the simulation itself, the Story remains accessible, allowing
												participants to refer to relevant information whenever needed. The
												ability to open and reread the Story during the simulation promotes a
												deeper understanding of the scenario, supports the learning objectives
												of the project management module, and facilitates achieving a good
												outcome within the simulation.

												In this area of the user interface, the average mood of the employees
												can be observed during the project based on three attributes. It shows
												the percentage of how the employees' mood develops or changes after each
												iteration. The better the values for each parameter throughout the
												simulation, the better the efficiency of the Employees and the outcome
												of the simulation will be in the end. Ideally, the stress value should
												be low, and the motivation and familiarity values should be high.
												<p>
													• <strong>Stress</strong>: If the tasks are too demanding and the
													employees are overwhelmed, the stress value increases. The deadline
													is also crucial because the closer it gets, the higher the stress
													level becomes. However, for an ideal and efficient workflow, the
													stress value should not be at 0 either. An ideal stress value would
													be around 20. Within the simulation, it is possible to lower the
													stress level through stress-reducing measures. An example of this
													would be team meetings. Hovering the mouse over the "Team Event"
													field also indicates that it reduces stress.
												</p>
												<p>
													• <strong>Motivation</strong>: The motivation value is also crucial
													for efficiency, as without motivation, the employees' mood
													decreases. Motivation is high when employees feel well-treated. For
													example, a team event would increase the motivation of the
													employees.
												</p>
												<p>
													• <strong>Familiarity</strong>: Familiarity describes the employees'
													familiarity with the tasks. Familiarity is important for employees
													to work efficiently together in the project and complete the tasks.
													Familiarity increases, for example, through the scheduling of
													meetings.

												Events are occurrences in the simulation triggered by specific trigger
												points. Trigger points are defined conditions that must be met for an
												event to be triggered. These events can have various effects and
												influence the behavior of the simulation. The events in the simulation
												help simulate challenges that a project team may face. They can be
												positive or negative events. A negative event, for example, could be the
												addition of additional tasks due to an increased stress level. A
												positive event could be the reduction of some tasks due to a high
												familiarity value. Depending on how well or poorly a simulation is
												conducted, positive or negative events can occur. An example of a
												trigger point could be when the stress level of team members in the
												simulation reaches 80% or higher. Once this trigger point is reached, an
												event is triggered. In this case, the event could result in an increase
												of 20 in the number of “remaining tasks” in the simulation. This
												reflects increased workload and presents an additional challenge for the
												team. Therefore, the event serves as a warning and emphasizes the need
												for a lower stress level and increased attention to stress in the
												future.

											<strong>
												Which steps have to be considered when performing a scenario simulation
												in order to achieve a high score?
											</strong>
											<br />
											First of all, it is important to understand the content of the scenario
											well. During the project, one should observe the magic triangle at all times
											and make sure that each component is taken into account. Also, after each

										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>How can I achieve a higher quality value?</strong>
											<br />
											For a high quality value, it is important to do a lot of testing and bug

											<br />
											Following integration testing, there may be additional tasks added to the
											"remaining tasks," which will increase the number of tasks. Integration
											testing is also crucial for ensuring high-quality end results.

											<strong>What happens if I answer the questions wrong?</strong>
											<br />
											The progression of the simulation is not directly affected by the questions.
											It gives the user the opportunity to earn points by answering the questions
											correctly, which increases the overall score.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>How is the result determined in the end?</strong>
											<br />
											The scores from Question Score, Budget Score, Quality Score, and Time Score
											are summed up at the end, resulting in the overall score.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>What happens if I exceed the budget?</strong>
											<br />
											If the specified budget is exceeded, the "Budget Score" will be
											correspondingly low. This will lead to a low overall score.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>What happens if I exceed the time limit?</strong>
											<br />
											If the deadline is not met and more time is needed for the project, the
											"Time Score" will be relatively low.This will lead to a low overall score.

											<strong>What are the differences between the employees?</strong>
											<br />
											The employees in the simulation differ in their roles and expertise. Each
											one of them brings unique skills and knowledge to the team. Seniors, for
											example, have more experience, cause fewer errors, and are more expensive.
											Juniors, for example, are much cheaper than seniors but do not have much
											experience and cause more errors. Software testers specialize in identifying
											and resolving bugs to ensure high-quality deliverables.

											<strong>What is the best way to choose employees?</strong>
											<br />
											Before choosing the employees, one should understand the story of the
											scenario well to be able to use the right employees. The best way to choose
											employees would be to follow a comprehensive and balanced approach. Tasks
											should not be performed by only one type of employee, if possible. For high
											efficiency, however, as many different employees as possible should be
											hired.

											<strong>
												How are events triggered in the simulation and what are their effects?
											</strong>
											<br />
											Events are occurrences in the simulation triggered by specific trigger
											points. Trigger points are defined conditions that must be met for an event
											to be triggered. These events can have various effects and influence the
											behavior of the simulation. The events in the simulation help simulate
											challenges that a project team may face. They can be positive or negative
											events. A negative event, for example, could be the addition of additional
											tasks due to an increased stress level. A positive event could be the
											reduction of some tasks due to a high familiarity value. Depending on how
											well or poorly a simulation is conducted, positive or negative events can
											occur. An example of a trigger point could be when the stress level of team
											members in the simulation reaches 80% or higher. Once this trigger point is
											reached, an event is triggered. In this case, the event could result in an
											increase of 20 in the number of "remaining tasks" in the simulation. This
											reflects increased workload and presents an additional challenge for the
											team. Therefore, the event serves as a warning and emphasizes the need for a
											lower stress level and increased attention to stress in the future.

											<strong>
												How does adjusting overtime impact team productivity and stress levels?
											</strong>
											<br />
											Encouraging overtime may increase productivity in the short term, as more
											hours are dedicated to work. On the other hand, overtime can lead to
											increased stress levels and fatigue among team members, potentially
											impacting their long-term performance.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>
												How does high stress levels affect error rates and team efficiency?
											</strong>
											<br />
											When team members experience high stress levels, their focus and
											concentration are compromised, leading to an increase in errors and
											mistakes.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>
												How do decisions made during the simulation influence the final outcome
												and project success?
											</strong>
											<br />
											Decisions made during the simulation have a direct impact on the final
											outcome. Wise decision-making, based on careful consideration of available
											information and objectives, can lead to favorable outcomes, such as meeting
											project goals and delivering high-quality results.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>
												How does the level of expertise of team members affect task completion
												time?
											</strong>
											<br />
											The level of expertise of team members has an impact on task completion
											time. Highly skilled (senior) team members can execute tasks more
											efficiently and effectively, resulting in shorter completion times and
											better quality.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>
												How does the choice of project management methodology impact the
												simulation outcomes?
											</strong>
											<br />
											Different methodologies, such as Waterfall or Agile, have unique strengths
											and weaknesses that impact factors like task scheduling and adaptability to
											change. Selecting an appropriate methodology aligned with project
											requirements and characteristics can enhance project outcomes and
											efficiency.
										</p>
										<p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
											<strong>
												How can I ensure effective communication and information sharing within
												the team?
											</strong>
											<br />
											Team events and meetings. Team events promote a positive team dynamic, while
											meetings provide focused discussions and ensure the necessary information is
											shared in a structured manner. Both approaches contribute to a collaborative
											and well-informed team environment.
